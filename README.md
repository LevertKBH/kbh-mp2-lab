Lab Results Application - Version 3.0.0 Release Notes
Release Date: October 2025
Release Type: Major Update
Overview
This is a major release of the Lab Results Application introducing key productivity and data-access enhancements.
Version 3.0 focuses on improved data visibility, streamlined reporting, and additional filtering capabilities to enhance operational efficiency across all plants.
1. Export Functionality
Users can now export lab results directly to Excel from within the application.
This functionality allows easy extraction and offline analysis of lab data for custom reporting or record-keeping.
 
Accessing the Export Feature
1.	Navigate to the Lab Results Table view.
2.	Click the EXPORT button at the top right of the screen.
3.	A pop-up toolbox will open with configurable options.





Export Options
Option	Description
Start Date	The start date of the data you wish to export. (If using a date range, this will be your starting point.)
End Date	The end date for the export range.
Select Plant	Choose which plant’s data to export (e.g., MP2, LIO, SAOB).
Select Hour	Filter lab data based on a specific test hour.
Export All Hours (Checkbox)	Overrides “Select Hour” and exports all hours for the date range.
Export All (Checkbox)	Exports all available lab data regardless of filters. NB: This may take several minutes depending on database size and system performance.
Once selections are made, press EXPORT.
The generated Excel file will automatically download to your default downloads folder (depending on your browser settings).
 
 
 
 
User Training
To ensure a smooth rollout, I will be available in person in Phalaborwa for any training sessions that will need be conducted.


2. New Filters on Entry Table
To improve data navigation and usability, two new filters have been added to the Entry Table view:
 
•	Hour Filter: View results by specific hour intervals.
•	Plant Filter: View only data relevant to your assigned plant (e.g., MP2, SAOB, or LIO).
These enhancements make it easier for plant users and supervisors to quickly locate and verify lab submissions.
